#### easy just call

````
RxPalette.analyze(loadedImage)
                .subscribe(new PaletteConsumer() {
                    @Override
                    public void onNext(List<Palette.Swatch> swatches) {
                        Palette.Swatch swatch = swatches.get(0);
                    }
                    @Override
                    public void onError(Throwable e) {
                    }
                });
````                

and you can also make use of observable features and [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) by calling in your application

````
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  
````
